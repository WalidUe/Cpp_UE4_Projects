1) int GetMaxTries() const; const here means no changes will be made to this entire object
SO WE CAN'T USE THIS:
int FBullCowGame::GetMaxTries() const {

	MyMaxTries = 12;// we can't change the value anymore!!
	return MyMaxTries;

}

2) // TODO summarize game, now go to View->Task List to view your TodoList
	we can view other tokens as well in the options menu such as UNDONE or HACK

3) static getters https://youtu.be/MR37gqFEmFA

4) enum class (to fix gloval variable problem)

5)Difference between // & /// in comments

6)Complex collision

7)Protect Pointer by initializing it to nullptr + if(!Pointer){return;}

8)Widget to focus on = (we can use the button here instead of the entire widget)

9)Forward declartions (we can use it in the .h file for example, & when methods are needed then use the include in the .cpp file)

10)UPROPERTY

11)HideCategories

12)UClass vs TSubclassOf
